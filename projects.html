        <h2>CS Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are a few projects I have worked on during my time at BU MET's MS in Software Development program.
          For more details, please visit my <span><a href="https://github.com/Xalvandor" target="_blank">GitHub</a></span>.</p>

            <h3>CS 521: House Plant Manager</h3>
            <p>I created an application using Python to help care for house plants. With this program,
              you can save your houseplants, when you acquired them, and log when you water them.
              You will receive an alert if you are watering too often or not enough. </p>

            <h3>CS 622: Gig Management</h3>
            <p>This is an application built for musicians for managing their events and gigs. Musicians can add gigs
              and rehearsals to their calendar along with set lists and other event information, such as time, place,
              and fee. This application was built using Java and SQLite.</p>

            <h3>CS 669: Yoga Database</h3>
            <p>For this course, I designed and implemented a database for a yoga flow creation database.
              This was designed from the ground up, starting with use cases, then writing structural database rules,
              followed by ERDs, then writing the SQL with SQLServer to deploy the database on Azure. I then enhanced
              the database by adding indexes, stored procedures and queries, triggers, and history tables.</p>

            <h3>CS 601: Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p>Using html, css, and Javascript, I designed a responsive and dynamic website for showcasing
              my projects and career highlights.</p>
