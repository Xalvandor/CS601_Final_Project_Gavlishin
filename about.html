    <h1>All About Me!</h1>
    <section>
      <p>I was born in Ukraine. I moved to the US when I was 4 years old. I grew up in the Philadelphia area.</p>
      <p>In college, I decided to study music and music education. I played classical guitar for recitals, weddings, and other events.</p>
      <p>After college, I lived in France for 2 years where I taught English in public elementary schools.</p>
      <p>After returning to the US, I became an ESL teacher in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Seeking a change and wanting to further challenge myself, I decided to pursue a Master's in Software Development at BU.</p>
